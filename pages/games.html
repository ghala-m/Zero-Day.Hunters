The attackers did not steal any financial data or sensitive information, but they left behind a strange encrypted message. This message was carefully hidden in the internal web page address of the company, and no one has been able to decrypt it so far. The company has enlisted a team of cyber investigators to solve the mystery of this message. The investigators believe that the message may contain a hidden threat or a plan for a larger attack. But the problem is that the code used is unknown, and there is no clear evidence on how to decrypt it. Your task is to help the investigators decrypt this message.
